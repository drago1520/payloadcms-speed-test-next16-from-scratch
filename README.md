This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
# Deprecated
This was a staging repo for the full re-write of [Burgas Business Hub (bbh)](https://github.com/drago1520/bbh)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```
This includes Docker containers for development with S3 buckets, email & MongoDB.
On changes to the Database structure run 
```bash
bun types2
```
to generate types.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Analytics
Posthog captures every event even with Brave & Ublock origin lite ad blockers. Automatic Error tracking on Client works even with Brave & Ublock origin ad blockers.

Tested Manually capturing Exception with Posthog:
```ts
const posthog = getPostHogServer()

try {
    throw new Error("This is a test exception for error tracking")
} catch (error) {
    posthog.captureException(error, 'test')
}
```
With Posthog source map upload at build time it is ~10-20% slower.


# Huge issue
It's not just about adding `.ts` extentions at this point. 
```log
file:///C:/projects/research/payload/dev-server-speed-test-mongodb/next-16-from-scratch/src/collections/Attendees.ts:1
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload';
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SyntaxError: The requested module 'payload' does not provide an export named 'CollectionConfig'
SyntaxError: The requested module 'payload' does not provide an export named 'CollectionConfig'
```
smth more serious is messed up. I tested with bun and pnpm.
